# Canonical project ledger

**Repository:** EndeavorEverlasting/BetterInstincts  
**Owner objective (2026-10-20):** A creative, freely distributed contribution to The Sims 4 modding community that makes Sims autonomously meet needs responsibly, generate income, improve career outcomes, and pursue more fulfilling lives. Start with an observable small win while retaining the entire multi-month vision here. Prefer community-standard languages/tooling and patterns; avoid inventing new systems unnecessarily.

## Non-negotiable product behavior
1. Player agency outranks all autonomy suggestions.
2. Needs and safety outrank money/career efficiency; leisure and character remain meaningful.
3. Different Sims should not converge on one robotic optimization loop.
4. Behavior must be configurable, individually defeatable, reversible, and performant.
5. No save alteration, arbitrary user directories, telemetry, hidden background tasks, or mass changes.

## State and evidence ledger
| Item | State | Evidence / proof ceiling |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Repository | VERIFIED | New public GitHub repo with initial README, MIT and Python gitignore; `main` initial commit f6d129ef84f7a31beb5ec3f2610e1e39bd9aa749. |
| Tool ecosystem | RESEARCHED | See docs/PRIOR_ART.md; Python + XML tuning prevalent, but exact local game build not inspected. |
| Doctrine | TARGETED IN BI-001 | Root governance + validator + CI proposed in this sprint; check merged commit before marking integrated. |
| Decision policy | OFFLINE PROTOTYPE | Pure Python scorer + synthetic tests only; NOT a game mod. |
| Game integration | UNPROVEN | No tested `.package` or `.ts4script`, no game observation. |
| Live performance/compatibility | UNPROVEN | Requires local game and disposable saves. |
| Public release | NOT AUTHORIZED | Requires docs/VALIDATION.md release gates. |

## Durable decisions (revise with evidence)
- First investigation: one observable base-game needs behavior (hunger) and its tuning/priority mechanism, not whole-game AI replacement.
- Alternative prioritization algorithms are hypotheses until live game comparison.
- Keep MIT for original code; third-party dependency license audits before any reuse.
- Honor community patterns: Sims 4 Studio for extraction/packaging research; consider XML Injector, Lot51 Core, S4CL only for justified integrations, not default dependencies.
- Use a single repo-local output root; require an explicitly provided, previewed install path for any future installer.

## Project fact discipline
Mark CURRENT FACT, OBSERVED IMPLEMENTED, DOCUMENTED UNVERIFIED, INFERRED, EVIDENCE GAP. A third-party README doesn't prove a game runtime behavior. Document exact Sims patch + pack list for game tests. Preserve rejected choices here rather than reopening settled questions without new evidence.

## Next parent gate
Prove **one** reversible tuning-based, base-game hunger autonomy improvement against a vanilla comparison on a disposable save; if tuning cannot implement this, capture that falsifying evidence and route a smallest justified script adapter. CI alone cannot close this gate.
